# Generating-cifar-10-fake-images-using-Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-DCGAN-
How can we build some real-looking fake images, using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks or DCGANs. GANs are basically known for their two networks, Generative network, and Discriminative network. We train our Discriminative model in such a way that it can tell us that which image is real and which image is fake. The generative network tries to create new images that can even fool the Discriminator network and prove themselves to be real.
